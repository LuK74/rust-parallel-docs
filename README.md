## Objective
It is inspired by the GNU parallel software to develop a command executor in parallel with the RUST language. The language is particularly interesting for its performance and the production of robust code.
RUST is a demanding language but recognized by experts.

## Technological constraints
- RUST: https://www.rust-lang.org/
- Tokio https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio

## Work plan
- RUST learning:
    - read the following book: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/
    - at the same time do the exercises: https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/
- install the language help tools to your editor: example vscode (Visual Studio Code)
